# Othello-using-AlphaBeta-pruning-algorithm

Othello is a classic chess game. My program currently supports man-machine mode , and the strategy is mainly based on AlphaBeta pruning algorithm. I haven't made any css style, and the evaluating function is too coarse to make the computer a good player at this moment. I will improve these things when I can spare some time.

Thanks for seeing this program.
